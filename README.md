# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

TRIED building a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The goal was for this app to run in the browser, featuring a dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

I was able to get the logic behind the assignment. I just got stuck in trying to tie the pieces together. 

MY GOAL/IDEA:

The index.html is the inital page with a short description of the game. When the <Start> is clicked, it will directly take you to the quiz.html page where the timer starts, as soon as the page loads, as well as the quiz. 

I had all my question/answers in my js file, however.. I just couldn't figure out how to connect the quiz.html and the script.js to actually show the questions/answers on the page. I was messing aroung with a few codes but I just wan't getting it entirely.
